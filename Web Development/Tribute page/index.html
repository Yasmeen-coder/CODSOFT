                <li>Biography</li>
                <li>Malala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Swat Valley, Pakistan. Her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, was an educator who ran several schools. She was a bright student who was passionate about learning, even in the face of adversity. When the Taliban took control of her region, they banned girls from attending school. Malala refused to remain silent and began speaking out publicly on behalf of girls and their right to an education.
                </li>
                <li>In early 2009, Malala wrote a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym, detailing her life under the Taliban's rule and the challenges faced in pursuing education. Her voice quickly gained recognition on the global stage. As her public profile rose, she continued to advocate for education despite increasing threats from the Taliban.
                </li>
                <li>On October 9, 2012, Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman while on her way home from school. The attack sparked international outrage and brought attention to the struggle for girls' education. Malala survived the assassination attempt and continued her activism. She co-authored the memoir "I Am Malala," which became an international bestseller. In 2014, at the age of 17, she became the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
